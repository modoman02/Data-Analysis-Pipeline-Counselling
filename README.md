# Agency Analytics Product (Friend Consulting)

This repository defines and prototypes a lightweight analytics product for a small marketing/video agency.
The goal is a simple system that turns structured activity data into consistent weekly insights, with clear
definitions and minimal manual effort.

What this project focuses on:
- A stable data model and metric definitions.
- A repeatable pipeline that cleans data and builds a single source of truth.
- A weekly summary report that supports business decisions.
- Low-friction usage for a non-technical owner.

Key documents live in `docs/`, especially:
- `docs/product_deliverable.md`
- `docs/next_steps_and_deliverables.md`
- `docs/usage_options.md`
